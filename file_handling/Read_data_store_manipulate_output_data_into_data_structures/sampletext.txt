Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Because I could not stop for Death,
